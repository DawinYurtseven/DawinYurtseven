# Hi! I'm Dawin Yurtseven

Hello there! My name is Dawin Yurtseven, an Informatics: Game Engineering student at the Technical University of Munich. I'm an aspiring game developer that loves story driven games the most. I'm looking forward to work together with passionate people. 

# Current Projects
I'm working on multiple projects. Although I haven't worked on them for a longer time, I started to work on them again as of lately. These projects are not completed yet but here is a short description about them as well as what has been implemented and needs to be implemented.

## ThunderPunk
ThunderPunk is supposed to be a fast-paced jump-n'-run that uses its physics-based controller for more complex movement.

Things that have been implemented so far:
- Movement along the x and y axis
- Camera control with Cinemachine 
- jump and dashes
- custom gravity that works on any object that has the "CurvedGround" tag
- a camera Focus for the LockDash function
- Spline System for custom paths that the player can walk, grind and jump on

Things that are planned to be implemented soon:
- [ ] LockDash function to reach further objects directly
- [ ] Grinding system for defined path movement
- [ ] custom character model with animations
- [ ] enemy who have limited reactions to the player


## Castle-In-The-Sky
Castle in the Sky is supposed to be a mobile story game which consists of a turn-based battle system and a visual novel like story before and after a fight. 

Things that have been implemented so far:
- Character Information for battles as well as their possible actions and reactions to enemy actions
- Battle system which goes the certain order of "player state" - "enemy state" until either side is dead
- simple UI placeholder that is responsive to a players possible actions
- movement towards target after certain actions via interpolation of character and target positions

Things that are planned to be implemented soon:
- [ ] Enemy Ai types for enemies
- [ ] proper animation and waiting time for custom animations
- [ ] visual novel system with corresponding ui
- [ ] reactive camera for battleflow 
- [ ] more dynamic UI which takes up less space
